======================
LCODE 3D documentation
======================

If you are interested in not just *what* LCODE does, but also *how* does it do it,
and you are reading this documentation for the first time,
the recommended procedure is to
glance over the first chapter and then
`dive straight into the source code <../html/_modules/lcode.html#dst2d>`_
switching back and forth using [source] and [docs] cross-links.
Trust us, at 500 lines of code it's even shorter than the docs,
and if you get stuck, you always have a link back to the explanations.
