==============

Geometry
--------
* :ref:`Quasistatic approximation <geometry>`
  reduces the problem dimensionality by one.

.. todo:: DOCS: write a separate page on the topic or link somewhere from the overview.


Numerical stability
-------------------

* :doc:`Helmholtz equation <../tour/ExEyBxBy>`
  increases numerical stability, optional.

* :doc:`'Variant A' <../tour/ExEyBxBy>`
  increases numerical stability, optional.

* :doc:`Coarse/fine plasma approach <../tour/coarse_and_fine_plasma>`
  increases numerical stability, optional.

* :doc:`Offset-coordinate separation <../technicalities/offsets>`
  (probably) probably helps with float precision.


Simplifications
---------------

* :doc:`Reflection boundary <../overview/window_and_grids>`
  is closer than the field calculation boundary to simplify boundary handling.
