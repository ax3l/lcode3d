The suggested followup workflow for the implementor would be:

* choose the most suitable parent branch;
* fork `<https://github.com/lotov/lcode3d>`_ or its fork;
* check it out locally;
* install dependencies (see ``requirements.txt``);
* verify that LCODE runs as-is;
* implement, test and commit changes;
* rebase it if the parent branch advances;
* submit a pull request;
* wait for it to be rebased-and-merged.
