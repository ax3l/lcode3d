Contributing
============

When contributing to this repository, please discuss the change you wish to make
via email (`team@lcode.info <mailto:team@lcode.info>`_),
issue tracker (`<https://github.com/lotov/lcode3d/issues>`_),
personal communication or any other method with our team.

The suggested followup workflow for the implementor would be:

* choose the most suitable parent branch;
* fork `<https://github.com/lotov/lcode3d>`_ or its fork;
* check it out locally;
* install dependencies (see ``requirements.txt``);
* verify that LCODE runs as-is;
* implement, test and commit changes;
* check that the code is still under 1000 SLOC;
* try to strip all the complex programming concepts and clever hacks;
* rebase it if the parent branch advances;
* submit a pull request;
* wait for it to be rebased-and-merged.
