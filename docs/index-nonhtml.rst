======================
LCODE 3D documentation
======================

.. note::
   Please consider using the online version of this document
   at http://lcode.readthedocs.org instead if you are reading this documentation
   for the first time and you are interested in the implementation details.

   Documentation in other formats is not officially supported,
   is not guaranteed to be complete and
   is generally provided only for convenience.


If you are interested in not just *what* LCODE does, but also *how* does it do it,
and you are reading this documentation for the first time,
the recommended procedure is to obtain it in HTML format,
glance over the first chapter and then
dive straight into the source code,
switching back and forth using [source] and [docs] cross-links
(available only in HTML version).
Trust us, at 500 lines of code it's even shorter than the docs,
and if you get stuck, you'll always have a link back to the explanations.
