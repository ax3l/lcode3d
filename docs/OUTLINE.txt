Overview:
  Problem and Physics: General, Beam, Plasma, Fields
  Problem domain trickery index: quasistatic, coarse/fine, helmholtz, variantA, reflect_boundary
  Simulation window and grids: fields and ro, reflection boundary, plasma boundary, two plasma grids
  Units

A tour of the simulations:
  Ez: problem and RHS, method, dst2d
  Ex,Ey,Bx,By: problem and RHS, method, variant A, dstdct2d
  Bz: TODO
  Plasma movement (w/o fields): equations, reflection, implementation
  Plasma movement with fields: equations, reflection, implementation
  TSC2D plasma shape: weights, interp9, deposit9
  Coarse and fine plasma: what, how
  Deposition
  Beam model
  Xi step: move-deposit-fields-move-deposit-fields-move-deposit

Technicalities:
  GPU calculations: cupy (and its limitations), numba kernels, my overly smart classes
  Initialization
  Optimal transverse grid sizes
  Design decisions:
    Codebase size
    Memory considerations
    Offset-coordinate separation
    Zero special boundary treatment
    Integer xi steps

Usage:
  Installation
  Configuration
  Running and embedding
